# docker-demo
This tool is used to demonstrate the use of environment versioning using python in a Docker image.  
The script will read a XLSX file, and run a function based on a command argument.
The script has several MATCH statements that require Python 3.10 or later, but can be used with IF / ELSE statements when used with Python 3.9 or earlier.
When used with Python 3.9 or earlier, lines 28-32 should be commented out in favor of lines 19-24.
